Just my academic PHP stuff and small websites

Inside the 'website' folder is my first academic project for my PG course. Wasn't intended as a project initially but as things developed I thought, why not?
And there's also a laravel website but it's only the basic CRUD & register/login stuff. 

The website folder is a small personal website with 7 main pages. 
An index/login page, registration page, user dashboard, edit personal details, edit security details, An image/video gallery and finally a user to user chatbox. 
Made using raw PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML and a little bit of javascript.
No PHP frameworks were used and all the CSS and designs were done from scratch by myself
I haven't decided to host it yet, but I included screenshots if you want to take a look
